Jabber Plugin for Grails
-------------------------

# What is the Jabber Plugin?

This is a small Grails plugin for Jabber which allows you to send and receive Jabber messages in your Grails app.


# Configuration

Read some instructions on how to use it at http://github.com/glenasmith/grails-jabber/wikis

(Updated for MUC listener support and copying in Glen's original Wiki content)
There is a little configuration required in your /conf/Config.groovy file. Add the following section and point it to your jabber server of choice:

<pre>
   chat {
        serviceName = "local.decaf"
        host = "localhost"
        port = 5222
        username = "glen"
        password = "password"
    }
</pre>

If you're using it with Google Talk, you'll want your settings to be something like:

<pre>
chat {
    serviceName = "gmail.com"
    host = "talk.google.com"
    port = 5222
    username = "yourid@gmail.com"
    password = "your_password"
}
</pre>

Once that's in, you can happily invoke sendJabberMessage(userId, content) from any of your controllers or services:

<pre>
sendJabberMessage("glen@decaf.local", "Just a tester....")
</pre>

If you'd like to listen for incoming Jabber messages, you need to add an 'expose' list similar to the JMS and Remoting plugin (which I used as the sample template for my plugin) to one of your service classes.

Added support for listening to extensions too.

<pre>
class DemoService {

    static expose = [ 'jabber' ]
    
    // if you want to listen on a MUC
    static room = 'room@conference.server'
    
    // for consuming an extension
    static elementName = 'SomeExtension'
    static namespace = 'http://the.extensions.namespace'
    
    def onJabberMessage = {msg ->

        println "Eeek a message!!! From ${msg.from} with body ${msg.body}"

        PacketExtension pe = msg.getExtension("SomeExtension", "http://the.extension.namespace")
        println "Ext: ${pe.toXML()}"
        
    }
}
</pre>

Eventually, the docs will move to http://www.grails.org/Jabber+Plugin
(This seems to be futile, as there is now a Grails-XMPP plugin in the repo. ???)
